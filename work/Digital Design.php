                <h2>FBLA Digital Design</h2>
                <p>
                    In my junior year of high school, I competed in Digital Design and Promotion for FBLA. The competition required my team to design a various assortment marketing and promotional material for a fictitious travel agency, Xtreme Adventure. In other words, we had to fully develop the brand and identity of a company.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We designed numerous different promotional items, including billboards, large banners, t-shirts, letterheads, business cards, luggage tags, corporate themed PowerPoint, etc. Our design is very minimalistic and uses “earthy” colors in order to symbolize the primary purpose of our company: adventuring. In the end, our efforts paid off as we became National Winners!

                <h2>T-Shirt Design</h2>
                <p>
                    Every year, the graduating class of my high school receives senior t-shirts and I was asked to design them for my class. Hoping to make our t-shirts stand out, I used thick fonts with a strong white outline for contrast. The final design came out to be nice and striking, so I created further prototypes and experimented with additional colors of my school.
