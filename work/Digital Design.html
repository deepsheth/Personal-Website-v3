            </h2>
                <p>
                    For mobiLEHIGH, a month long game development competition (similar to LU Apps), I prototyped the interface of our game. Along with designing graphics, I created promotional materials for our showcase. Our goal was to develop a cross-platform puzzle game using the <a href="https://libgdx.badlogicgames.com/">libGDX</a> game engine. This framework was particularly useful since it relies on Java, a language everyone in my team was comfortable using.

                <h2 id="fbla">FBLA Digital Design</h2>
                <p>
                    A while back, I competed in the Digital Design and Promotion event for <a href="http://www.njfbla.org/">FBLA</a>. The competition required my team to design marketing and promotional material for a fictitious travel agency (Xtreme Adventure). With our strong performance at the state level, we advanced to nationals where my teammate and I presented our vision of Xtreme Adventure's brand/identity in front of a panel of judges.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We designed a number of promotional items, including billboards, large banners, t-shirts, letterheads, business cards, luggage tags, etc. Our design is minimalistic and uses “earthy” colors in order to symbolize the primary purpose of our company: outdoor adventuring.

                <p>
                    Clubs and organizations have requested me to design mock-ups for them in the past. The designs below were for the seniors in my graduating high school class. I created a number of color variations to allow my class members to pick their favorite shirt design.
