            <h2>Front-end Framework: CobbleStone</h2>
            <p>
                CobbleStone is a front-end framework that I helped develop in order to jump start web development projects. CobbleStone enables websites to be easily coded, with its robust grid system and built-in responsive web design features. By making the front-end easy to work with, this allows web developers to focus more on the aesthetics and back-end of a website rather than to worry about why pixels do not precisely align on a webpage. It is extremely easy to implement CobbleStone to any website â€” the built-in features are heavily documented in order to prevent confusion and make web development more exciting!

            <h2>Fedora Productions</h2>
            <p>
                My high school had a student run record label which typically released new albums annually. In order to reach a larger audience, the albums were released on iTunes, CD Baby, and other online platforms. As a member of Fedora Productions, I tried to help the organization grow by designing a website that would serve as the central medium for releasing news, recruiting artists, and selling albums.
